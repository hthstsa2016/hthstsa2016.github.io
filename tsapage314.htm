                <p>I organize meetings (both officer and chapter), plan competition placement, send updates to and communicate with the rest of the chapter, and generally try to continually improve HTHS TSA</p>
                <h4> competitions involved in: </h4>
                <p> Transportation Modeling, Digital Video Production </p>
                <h4> favorite part about TSA: </h4>
                <p> I love that above all, TSA is a community of people who are all passionate about STEM. We help each other learn, and we push each other to be better. Whenever I go to a conference, whether it's a State or National Conference, I am always struck by how everyone bonds over their shared interests.</p>
                <h4> why I do TSA: </h4>
                <p> There is always room to improve and grow, and TSA really fosters that growth by giving us as high school students the opportunity to pick a competition and field we are interested in, and then to become well-versed in that area of study or application. There are a multitude of competitions to choose from, and over the years, I have personally picked up knowledge in things like modeling, carving, 3D CAD, alternative energy, military vehicles, etc. through my competing in the Transportation Modeling competition. </p>
                <h5> I am thrilled to also give back to my school community by helping lead our chapter's TSA; it's an honor to spread the love of technology and curiosity that TSA inspires. </h5>

                <h4> why I do TSA: </h4>
                <p> I do TSA for the fun and experience I get from completing the projects- I've learned how to efficiently work together and have also been exposed to new things such as Arduino. Traveling with friends is also a great experience. TSA has honestly been a great experience and I'd definitely do it again if I were to relive high school.  </p>

                <p> My favorite part about TSA is the TSA student community. It's really exciting to meet and interact with really talented students who are interested in such a variety of STEM topics.</p>
                <h4> why I do TSA: </h4>
                <p> I am passionate about technology and hope to pursue a future in the STEM field. I think TSA is a great way for me to explore new topics that I wouldn't have otherwise been exposed to. </p>

                <p> My favorite part about TSA is working on the projects with others and exploring more about STEM in areas that I might never have had the chance to delve into without this opportunity.</p>
                <h4> why I do TSA: </h4>
                <p> It helps me explore my interests in STEM before I go off to college, and it supplements the STEM-focused learning at HTHS already. I also really like to lead others, and working as a TSA officer has been a fun, challenging, but rewarding experience. </p>

                <h4> favorite part about TSA: </h4>
                <p> My favorite part of TSA is the lunch at TCNJ. After working hard the week before, it feels good to sit down with team members and just relax and eat.</p>
                <p> The following is my strategy for getting the most out of TSA lunch:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>I like to starve myself the week before to increase my appetite. It is important to stay hydrated to avoid health complications.</li>
                  <li>At the actual buffet, I start by sampling each stand. I get small portions of each and put them on the same plate to objectively compare their tastiness.</li>
                  <li>After sampling, I move on to the actual eating. I will choose my top 5 dishes and eat a full plate of each. </li>
                  <li>For drinks, I like to mix everything available in the soda machines to get a more holistic view. </li>
                </ul>
                <h4> why I do TSA: </h4>
                <p> It gives me a reason to explore different subjects in STEM that I am interested in. From robotics to dragster design, there are so many different interesting competitions available. </p>

        <h3> New Jersey State Conference </h3>
        <p> The NJ TSA High School State Conference is held every spring at the College of New Jersey. Students choose which <a href= "http://tsaweb.org/High-School-Competitions">competitions </a> they want to participate in at the beginning of the school year. A national competition guide is available to the students, which provides them with the guidelines necessary to complete their project. A state supplement modifies the rules specific to the State Conference. Events may be pre-conference (submitted at an earlier date than the actual conference) or on-site, and high school students all around the state come to TCNJ to compete. Winners of events qualify to compete at the National TSA Conference. </p>

        <h3> National Conference </h3>
        <p>The National TSA Conference is held at in the early summer at a different location each year. The 2016 conference will be in Nashville, Tennessee from 6/28 to 7/2 with a theme of “Building a Legacy.” Past locations include Texas, Washington DC, Florida, Maryland, and Colorado. The conference beings with a Conference Kick-Off where the participants are welcomed to the conference. Students can network and meet participants from other states in a pin-exchange. Later, at the TSA Meet and Greet, students can meet national officer candidates along with educational and industry representatives. Competitions will take place throughout the conference, and the awards ceremony at the end will recognize the top ten competitors in each event. The National Conference is a great learning experience and an excellent chance to meet people from all over the country; everyone goes home a winner!</p>

        <h3> VEX </h3>
        <p>The VEX Robotics Competition (VRC) is a robotics event for high schoolers. Teams build robots to complete an annual challenge. For the 2015-2016 season, the VRC challenge is Nothing But Net, in which teams try to score balls into low and high goals in 2-minute rounds. This was first year that the 5-member HTHS team, Team 765A, competed in the VRC challenge. They won the most prestigious award available, the Excellence Award, at their regional competition, where they were also tournament finalists. This qualified them for the state-level competition, where they reprised their success, winning the state-level Excellence Award and becoming tournament finalists there as well. These awards qualify them for the international level of competition, VEX Worlds, where they will be competing in mid-April. At the 2016 TSA State Conference, the HTHS VEX Team battled to become both the Robot Skills and Tournament Champion. The team will soon take on the TSA VEX challenge at the national conference. Hopes are high, as they've been on a winning streak since the state conference.</p>
